Attackers can leverage information from past security breaches that an organization might have experienced. 
They may, for example, leverage the following data while trying to gather information about their victims:
    Password dumps
    File metadata
    Strategic search engine analysis/enumeration
    Website archiving/caching
    Public source code repositories

    
Password Dumps
Ways an attacker can get access to such password dumps are Pastebin, dark web websites, and even GitHub in some cases.
 An example of a tool that allows you to find email addresses and passwords exposed in previous breaches is h8mail.
You can install h8mail by using;

pip3 install h8mail
